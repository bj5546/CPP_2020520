## Before You Start
It's assumed that you've installed the appropriate version of OpenVINO, including the Model Optimizer, in the default /opt/intel directory.  If you've installed to a different directory you may need to change the directory pathways in the commands below.

If you're using an earlier version, refer to this [document](./README.md). 

Use the appropriate directory and tutorial for the version of OpenVINO you've installed.
